As well as providing a first encounter with the main issues that underlie attempts to create Artificial Intelligence, the module also has a more practical component that introduces algorithms and data structures for AI problem solving through practical programming examples, as well as hands-on experience with simple programming of robots. The emphasis here is on identifying the abstract nature of the problem that is to be solved, matching this to an appropriate algorithm or technique and implementing a solution. It also serves as an introduction to programming for research rather than for software engineering.",

This module introduces the skill-set that is required to get to grips with such systems. It teaches students how to reverse-engineer and appraise complex, unwieldy systems by implementing source code and execution analysis techniques. It also presents a range of strategies that can be used to adapt and reengineer such systems to improve their quality and viability.",

        "description": "Cyber Security Team Project is a module that equips students with the knowledge needed to keep an organisation secure from today's cyber security threats and presents the necessary steps to take when a breach occurs.\n\nUsing a combination of learning methods and teaching techniques such as project based learning, active learning and case studies, this module teaches cyber security management principles that are needed to secure the digital assets of an organisation. A major part of this module involves students working in teams to evaluate and develop secure policies and strategies to solve real-world cyber security issues for organisations.\n\nStudents should be aware that there are limited places available on this module.",

        "description": "In the individual research project, you will complete a major original piece of software design, or an experimental investigation.  This work will be reported formally in a research dissertation and also presented at a project presentation session, to which industrial representatives, students and academics are invited.  The work will include an Interim report that consists of an initial survey and literature review.  You will be engaged in a major piece of software development, or the design and execution of an empirical experiment.  You will have regular meetings with your supervisor, who will advise on any problems you encounter.  You will prepare an 7,000-14,000 word dissertation, which includes the material from the interim report, but also contains a complete design, implementation and evaluation of the results of your project.  This may be assessed by oral examination.",

        "description": "The module is designed to introduce engineering students to key areas of financial and legal risk that engineers should be aware of in their working environment. The module will draw directly on practical issues of budgeting, raising finance, assessing financial risks and making financial decisions in the context of engineering projects and/or product development. At the same time the module will develop students' understanding of the legal aspects of entering into contracts for the development and delivery of engineering projects and products and an awareness of environmental regulation, liability for negligence, intellectual property rights and the importance of data protection. Through a series of parallel running lectures in the two disciplines, the module will provide a working knowledge of the two areas and how they impinge on engineering practice. There will be a heavy emphasis on group working, report writing and presentation as part of the assessment supplemented by online exercises and an individual portfolio.",
